# Livability Analysis on the Top 40 Largest Cities (Population) in the US
## Group Project for Correlation One's DS4A Cohort 2.0 (August 2020)
---

My contributions to this group project were around gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from the US Census, FBI Hate Crimes Database, and MIT Elections Lab. 

Notebooks I created can be found in the code folder. 

Tableau dashboards I created can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adriana.machado7103).

A video of our final presentation (which I edited and put together) and Tableau files are available just not here on GitHub due to size constraints. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions!
